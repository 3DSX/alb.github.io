# driftin.io bots

Bots for [driftin.io](http://driftin.io) written by InitialFail.

Currently there are two bots. The original bot is a Buster aimbot, and another is a racing bot for Drift Race mode.

Both bots are a WIP. See the Issues page for enhancements that are more than likely to be implemented. See the Projects page for ideas that may or may not make it in.

## How to use

Bots are tested on Chrome/Chromium. There are scripts for Linux that ease their launch:
* `start_freeforall.sh` starts the Buster aimbot in Free For All mode
* `start_race.sh` starts the Flash racing bot in Drift Race mode

## Contributing

Leave problems, suggestions, and questions on the Issues page. Pull requests are okay too, but large changes should be proposed through an issue first (unless it's already planned and I'm not working on it).
